It is an iOS app for a multi organization invoice management system. This app was developed with colaborating with a front-end team who developed the website for this system and back-end team who helped design the database and the REST APIs.

Currently the App has 3 levels in its hierarchy, Root - Super Admin - Admin.

This app was made for care-giving organizations such as Hospitals, Pharamacies and Diagnostic Centers.

Each Organizations has different criterias and functions and thus different ways of generating an invoice. Hospitals Book Appointments From Doctors, Pharamacies generate bills from drugs, Diagnostic Centers charge for investigations.

The App Will let you generate a PDF of the invoices as well as store them in a database for admins and super admins to refer to.

This App is made using SWIFT and SWIFTUI. No third party Library Was Used.

It was the project of my Software Engineering internship at Square Healt Ltd.
